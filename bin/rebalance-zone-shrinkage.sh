# This script generates a final cluster.xml after dropping a zone from the current
# cluster. The final cluster is placed in the $output_file.

# Argument = -c current_cluster -d drop_zoneid -o output_file
#
# This script steals partitions from other nodes in the zone that is being dropped 
# and assigns them to the nodes in the surviving zones.

# This script uses getopts which means only single character switches are allowed.
# Using getopt would allow for multi charcter switch names but would come at a
# cost of not being cross compatible.
